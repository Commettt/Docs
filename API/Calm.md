# Calm
Calm is a protocol developed and maintained by Commet Communications, mainly used in our [Commet app](https://app.commet.lol) created in TypeScript. However, due to its [open source nature](https://github.com/Commettt/Calm), anyone can use its code and system!

# Calm\Clients
Since Calm's API is easy to understand for anyone, you could even create a CLI or even a Scratch client!

The main client we recommend is [Commet](https://about.commet.lol) due to its easy-to-register OAuth system and Slack-like UI!

Clients:

- [Commet](https://about.commet.lol)
- Scratch.IM (no link at this time)

If you would like to add your own client, then edit this doc on [GitHub](https://github.com/Commettt/Docs/blob/main/API/Calm.md).

# Calm\contribute
Just like any of our other open services, you can edit Calm using a well-known developer tool, Git. We host our code on GitHub, and the system has different libraries to it. The one we used in Commet is written in JavaScript.
